        Hello, I got something to tell you
But it's crazy, I got something to show you
So give me just one more chance, one more glance
And I will make of you another believer

Guess what? You got more than you bargained
Ain't it crazy? You got more than you paid for
So give me just one more chance, one more glance
One more hand to hold

You've been on my mind (you've been on my mind)
Though it may seem I'm fooling
Wasting so much time (wasting so much time)
Though it may seem I'm fooling
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do?)
What are we gonna do about it?

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

So then, that is all for the moment
Until next time, until then, do not worry
And give me just one more chance, one more glance
And I will make of you, yeah, I'm gonna make of you another believer

You've been on my mind (you've been on my mind)
Though it may seem I'm fooling
Wasting so much time (wasting so much time)
Though it may seem I'm fooling
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do?)
What are we gonna do about it?

Hello, I got something to tell you, ooh, another believer
Hello, I got something to show you, ooh, another believer
You've been on my mind (you've been on my mind)
Seem I'm fooling

Wasting so much time (wasting so much time)
One more time, seem I'm fooling
Hello, I got something to tell you (you've been on my mind)
One more time, seem I'm fooling
Hello (one more chance) wasting so much time
